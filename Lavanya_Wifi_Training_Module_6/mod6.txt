 1. What are the pillars of Wi Fi security?  
The three key pillars are:
    Authentication   – Verifies the identity of users/devices.
    Encryption   – Secures data in transit.
    Integrity   – Ensures data has not been altered in transit.

   

      2. Authentication vs. Encryption in Wi Fi Security  
    Authentication  : Validates who is connecting (e.g., password based or certificate based).
    Encryption  : Protects the actual data being transmitted from eavesdroppers.

   

      3. Differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3  
| Feature | WEP | WPA | WPA2 | WPA3 |
|        |     |     |      |      |
| Cipher | RC4 | TKIP | AES (CCMP) | GCMP 256 |
| Security | Weak | Moderate | Strong | Stronger + Forward Secrecy |
| Introduced | 1997 | 2003 | 2004 | 2018 |
| Vulnerabilities | Easily cracked | Better, but flawed | Secure | Most secure today |

   

      4. Why is WEP considered insecure?  
  Uses static keys and   RC4 encryption  .
  Weak   initialization vectors (IVs)  .
  Can be cracked in   minutes   with modern tools.

   

      5. Why was WPA2 introduced?  
  To replace WPA and WEP due to their vulnerabilities.
  Introduced   AES based encryption (CCMP)   for robust protection.

   

      6. Role of Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in 4 Way Handshake  
    PMK   is derived from the pre shared key or 802.1X authentication.
  Used to create the   Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)  .
  Foundation for secure encryption of data.

   

      7. How does the 4 way handshake ensure mutual authentication?  
  Confirms both client and AP   know the PMK  .
  Exchanges nonces and generates   unique encryption keys  .
  Prevents man in the middle and replay attacks.

   

      8. What if we put the wrong passphrase during the handshake?  
  The   PMK generated won’t match  .
  The handshake fails, and no session is established.
  Connection is rejected.

   

      9. What problem does 802.1X solve in a network?  
  Provides   port based network access control  .
  Allows   centralized authentication   using RADIUS.
  Ideal for enterprise networks needing   individual credentials  .

   

      10. How does 802.1X enhance Wi Fi security?  
  Uses   EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)   to authenticate users.
  Prevents unauthorized access.
  Enables   dynamic key generation  , increasing overall security.
