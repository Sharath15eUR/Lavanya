1. Key features of Wi Fi 6, 6E, and 7 vs. Wi Fi 5 (802.11ac)  

    Wi Fi 6 (802.11ax)  : OFDMA, Target Wake Time (TWT), MU MIMO uplink, BSS Coloring.
    Wi Fi 6E  : Extends Wi Fi 6 into the   6 GHz band   (less interference, more bandwidth).
    Wi Fi 7 (802.11be)  : Adds   MLO  , 320 MHz channels, 4K QAM, and enhanced latency control.
    Wi Fi 5 (802.11ac)  : Limited to   5 GHz  , single user MIMO.

   

      2. Role of OFDMA in Wi Fi 6  

    OFDMA   divides a channel into   smaller sub channels (Resource Units)  .
  Multiple users can transmit simultaneously.
  Greatly improves   efficiency   in dense environments and reduces latency.

   

      3. Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT)  

  Allows devices to   negotiate wake/sleep schedules  .
  Reduces energy usage—ideal for   IoT and battery powered devices  .
  Enhances overall airtime management and network longevity.

   

      4. Significance of the 6 GHz band in Wi Fi 6E  

  Provides   1200 MHz   of additional spectrum.
  Less congested than 2.4/5 GHz bands →   lower latency and higher throughput  .
  Supports   more channels  , reducing overlap/interference.

   

      5. Wi Fi 6 vs. Wi Fi 6E (Range, Bandwidth, Interference)  

| Feature        | Wi Fi 6            | Wi Fi 6E                    |
|                |                    |                             |
| Frequency      | 2.4 GHz / 5 GHz     | 6 GHz only                  |
| Range          | Longer indoors      | Slightly shorter (higher freq) |
| Bandwidth      | Moderate            | High (due to extra spectrum) |
| Interference   | Higher              | Low (new band, fewer users)  |

   

      6. Innovations in Wi Fi 7 (802.11be)  

    320 MHz channels   (double bandwidth of Wi Fi 6).
    Multi Link Operation (MLO)  .
    4096 QAM   (higher modulation for more data).
    CMU MIMO   (Coordinated Multi User MIMO).
  Better AR/VR support with ultra low latency.

   

      7. Multi Link Operation (MLO)  

  Enables simultaneous use of   multiple frequency bands   (2.4/5/6 GHz).
  Increases   throughput   and provides   failover/redundancy  .
  Reduces latency by distributing traffic dynamically.

   

      8. Purpose of 802.11k and v (Roaming Aids)  

    802.11k  : Helps clients   discover the best AP   nearby (Neighbor Report).
    802.11v  : Allows APs to   suggest better APs   to clients (BSS Transition Management).
  Combined, they enable   smarter roaming decisions  .

   

      9. Fast BSS Transition (802.11r)  

  Allows devices to   roam faster   between APs by   pre authenticating  .
  Reduces roaming time from hundreds of ms to ~50 ms or less.
  Ideal for   VoIP and mobile   devices needing continuous connectivity.

   

      10. How 802.11k/v/r work together for enterprise roaming  

    802.11k  : Finds available APs.
    802.11v  : Recommends which AP to roam to.
    802.11r  : Enables fast secure transition to that AP.
  Together, they create   seamless, low latency roaming  , especially important in enterprise or campus networks.
