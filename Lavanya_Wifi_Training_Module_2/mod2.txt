1)Split MAC Architecture and Performance Benefits
Split MAC architecture divides the MAC layer functionalities between the Access Point (AP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). Time-sensitive functions such as client association and acknowledgements are handled by the AP , while higher-level functions like QoS, roaming decisions, and security policies are managed by the WLC. This improves performance by offloading complex tasks to a centralized WLC, reduces AP cost and complexity, and allows easier updates and control.

2)CAPWAP Protocol and Flow Between AP and Controller
CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol that allows communication between (Light weight Access Points) LWAPs and a WLC. The AP discovers the WLC, joins it via the control tunnel, and then establishes a data tunnel. The control tunnel handles management and configuration messages, while the data tunnel transports client data traffic. This architecture centralizes network management and enhances security.

3)CAPWAP in OSI Model and Tunnel Types
CAPWAP operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) using UDP. It uses two tunnels:

Control Tunnel (UDP 5246): Handles configuration, firmware, and management commands.

Data Tunnel (UDP 5247): Carries end-user traffic from AP to WLC.
This separation ensures secure and organized handling of both types of communication.

4)Lightweight APs vs. Cloud-based APs

Lightweight APs: Depend on an on-site WLC for control and management.

Cloud-based APs: Are managed through a cloud controller over the internet (e.g., Cisco Meraki).
Cloud-based APs offer better scalability, remote access, and automatic updates, while lightweight APs are more suitable for secure and controlled environments with on-prem management.

5)CAPWAP Tunnel Maintenance
The CAPWAP tunnel between an AP and WLC is maintained through regular keep-alive messages. These ensure that both devices are reachable and synchronized. If a specified number of keep-alive packets are missed, the tunnel is considered broken, and reconnection procedures are initiated. DTLS may be used for securing the tunnel.

6)Sniffer Mode vs. Monitor Mode

Sniffer Mode: Captures raw 802.11 traffic and sends it to a protocol analyzer (e.g., Wireshark). Used for deep packet inspection and troubleshooting.

Monitor Mode: Used for RF monitoring, detecting rogue APs, interference, and collecting performance metrics. The AP does not serve clients in either mode.

7)Best AP Mode When WLC Is in WAN
FlexConnect Mode is ideal when the WLC is located remotely (e.g., across a WAN). In this mode, APs can locally switch client data and continue to serve clients even when the WLC is unreachable. It combines centralized control with local survivability.

8)Challenges of Deploying Autonomous APs in Large Networks

-Manual configuration and management overhead

-Inconsistent security and QoS policies

-Difficult firmware updates

-No centralized visibility or troubleshooting tools
These issues make autonomous APs inefficient for large-scale deployments like universities.

9)Client Behavior if WLC Goes Down (Local Mode)
In Local Mode, APs rely on the WLC for all operations. If the WLC goes down, APs lose their control connection and stop serving clients after a timeout. This leads to service disruption. Only FlexConnect mode allows continued operation in the event of WLC failure.
