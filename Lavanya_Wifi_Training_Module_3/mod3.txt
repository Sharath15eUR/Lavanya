      1. What are the different 802.11 PHY layer standards? Compare their characteristics.  

The PHY layer determines how data is physically transmitted over the wireless medium. Key standards:

| Standard   | Frequency | Modulation | Max Speed | Key Feature              |
|            |           |            |           |                           |
| 802.11a    | 5 GHz     | OFDM       | 54 Mbps   | Faster, but shorter range |
| 802.11b    | 2.4 GHz   | DSSS       | 11 Mbps   | First popular Wi Fi       |
| 802.11g    | 2.4 GHz   | OFDM       | 54 Mbps   | Backward compatible with b |
| 802.11n    | 2.4/5 GHz | MIMO+OFDM  | 600 Mbps  | Introduced multiple streams |
| 802.11ac   | 5 GHz     | MU MIMO    | 1+ Gbps   | High throughput, beamforming |
| 802.11ax   | 2.4/5/6 GHz | OFDMA + MU MIMO | 10 Gbps | Efficient for dense networks |


      2. What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work?  

Both are   spread spectrum techniques   used to reduce interference.

    DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)   spreads the signal across a wide frequency using a pseudo random code. It increases resistance to interference and enables multiple users on the same band.
  
    FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)   changes the carrier frequency rapidly during transmission, reducing the chance of interference.
   

      3. How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer?  

Modulation is how digital bits are converted to signals.

    BPSK (1 bit/symbol)  : Very reliable, but slow.
    QPSK (2 bits/symbol)  : Moderate speed and reliability.
    16 QAM, 64 QAM, 256 QAM  : Higher speeds by encoding more bits per symbol, but sensitive to noise.
   

      4. What is the significance of OFDM in WLAN?  

  OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)   splits the signal into multiple subcarriers.

  Reduces interference and   multipath fading  
  Enables   higher data rates   and efficient channel use
  Used in 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax
   

      5. How are frequency bands divided for Wi Fi?  

Wi Fi operates on:

    2.4 GHz band  : 11â€“14 channels (3 non overlapping), better range
    5 GHz band  : More non overlapping channels, faster speeds
    6 GHz band (Wi Fi 6E)  : Ultra high speeds, less interference

Different countries allow different channel ranges (regulated by governments).


      6. What is the role of Guard Intervals in WLAN transmission?  

Guard Intervals prevent data symbols from overlapping due to signal reflections (multipath).

    Standard GI  : 800 ns (more protection)
    Short GI  : 400 ns (less protection, higher throughput)

Short GI increases speed but can lead to errors in noisy environments.

  
      7. Describe the structure of an 802.11 PHY layer frame.  

The   PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit)   includes:

    PLCP Preamble  : For synchronization and channel estimation
    PLCP Header  : Contains info like data rate and length
    PSDU (MAC Data)  : Actual payload (user data)


      8. Difference between OFDM and OFDMA?  

    OFDM  : Used by one device at a time; high throughput
    OFDMA  : Multiple users can transmit simultaneously on different subcarriers

OFDMA reduces   latency   and improves efficiency in crowded networks (used in Wi Fi 6).


      9. Difference between MIMO and MU MIMO?  

    MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)  : Uses multiple antennas to increase speed for one device.
    MU MIMO (Multi User MIMO)  : Serves multiple devices at once.

MU MIMO is ideal for environments with many users (e.g., offices, stadiums).


      10. What are PPDU, PLCP, and PMD in the PHY layer?  

    PPDU  : The complete physical frame sent over the air.
    PLCP  : Converts MAC layer data into a format usable by PHY.
    PMD  : Handles actual signal modulation and transmission.

  
      11. What are the types of PPDU?  

Different generations have unique PPDU formats:

    Legacy PPDU  : 802.11a/g
    HT PPDU  : 802.11n
    VHT PPDU  : 802.11ac
    HE PPDU  : 802.11ax   

      12. How is the data rate calculated?  

Data rate= (Nsd*Nbpscs*R*Nss)/(Tdft+Tgi)

Where,
Nsd-> No. of Data subcarriers
Nbpscs-> No. of coded bits per subcarrier per stream
R-> Coding 
Nss-> No. of spatial streams
Tdft-> OFDM symbol duration
Tgi-> Guard interval duration
