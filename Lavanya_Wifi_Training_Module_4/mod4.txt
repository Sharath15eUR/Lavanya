      1. What is the significance of MAC layer and in which position it is placed in the OSI model?  

  The   MAC (Media Access Control) layer   is part of the   Data Link Layer (Layer 2)   in the OSI model.
  It handles   framing, addressing (MAC addresses), access control, and error detection  .
  In Wi Fi, it coordinates how and when devices access the shared wireless medium to avoid collisions.

   

      2. Describe the frame format of the 802.11 MAC header and explain the purpose of each field.  

The MAC header includes:

    Frame Control  : Type of frame (Management, Control, Data), and flags.
    Duration/ID  : Time the channel is reserved for transmission.
    Address Fields   (1 to 4): Used for Source, Destination, BSSID, etc.
    Sequence Control  : Frame number and fragmentation info.
    QoS Control (if present)  : Quality of Service data for prioritized traffic.
    HT Control (optional)  : For high throughput operations (802.11n and above).

   

      3. MAC Layer Functionalities in Management, Control, and Data Planes  

    Management Frames  : Beacon, Probe Request/Response, Association/Disassociation—used for network discovery and joining.
    Control Frames  : RTS/CTS, ACK, Block ACK—used for reliable delivery.
    Data Frames  : Carry actual payload between clients and AP.

Each plane serves a specific role in maintaining wireless communication.

   

      4. Explain the scanning process and its types  

  Scanning   helps a device discover available Wi Fi networks.

    Passive Scanning  : Listens for   beacon frames   from APs.
    Active Scanning  : Sends   probe requests   and listens for   probe responses  .

Used during initial connection, roaming, and quality monitoring.

   

      5. Brief about the client association process  

Steps:
1.   Scanning   (to discover networks)
2.   Authentication   (initial security check)
3.   Association Request   (client asks to join)
4.   Association Response   (AP allows or denies connection)

After association, client can start data transmission.

   

      6. EAPOL 4 Way Handshake  

Used in   WPA/WPA2/WPA3   security for generating encryption keys:

1. AP sends   ANonce   to client.
2. Client uses ANonce + PMK to generate   PTK  , then sends   SNonce   to AP.
3. AP calculates PTK, sends confirmation.
4. Client installs encryption keys and confirms.

Purpose: Ensure   mutual authentication   and derive   unique session keys  .

   

      7. Power Saving Schemes in MAC Layer  

Techniques include:

    Listen Interval  : Client tells AP how often it wakes up.
    PS Poll  : Client asks for buffered data from AP.
    U APSD (Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery)  : Used with QoS.
    Target Wake Time (Wi Fi 6)  : Allows scheduling of wake up times, saving energy.

Used in mobile and battery operated devices.

   

      8. Medium Access Control (MAC) Methodologies  

Wi Fi uses   CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)  :

1. Device checks if channel is free.
2. If free, sends data. If busy, waits random backoff time.
3. Uses   RTS/CTS   or   ACK   for reliability.

Designed to reduce collisions in wireless medium.

   

      9. Block ACK Mechanism  

  Instead of acknowledging every frame individually, devices can acknowledge   a block of frames  .
  Improves throughput and reduces overhead.
  Useful in high throughput modes (802.11n/ac/ax).

   

      10. A MSDU, A MPDU, and A MSDU in A MPDU  

Used for   frame aggregation   to increase throughput:

    A MSDU (Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit)  : Multiple MSDUs in one MPDU.
    A MPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit)  : Multiple MPDUs in one PPDU.
    A MSDU in A MPDU  : Nesting A MSDUs inside A MPDUs for maximum efficiency.

Aggregation reduces header overhead and increases efficiency.
