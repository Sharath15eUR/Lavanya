1. In which OSI layer does the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fit?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model has seven layers, and Wi-Fi primarily operates at:  
- Layer 1 (Physical Layer): Deals with the actual transmission of radio waves over air. Wi-Fi standards define frequencies, signal strength, and modulation techniques.  
- Layer 2 (Data Link Layer): Handles MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, authentication, encryption, and frame transmissions. Wi-Fi uses MAC addresses for communication instead of IP addresses at this layer.  


2. Share the Wi-Fi devices you use daily and their wireless capabilities. Match them to Wi-Fi generations based on properties. 

1. Smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S23, iPhone 14, OnePlus 11, etc.)  
   - Wi-Fi Generation: Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)  
   - Frequency Bands: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz (some support 6 GHz in Wi-Fi 6E)  
   - Max Speed: 9.6 Gbps (in ideal conditions)  
   - Special Features: MU-MIMO, OFDMA for improved efficiency in crowded networks  

2. Laptop (MacBook Pro M2, Dell XPS, Lenovo ThinkPad, etc.)  
   - Wi-Fi Generation: Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) or Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)  
   - Frequency Bands: 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz  
   - Special Features: Dual-band support, beamforming for better signal strength  

3. Smart TV (LG OLED, Samsung Smart TV, Sony Bravia, etc.)  
   - Wi-Fi Generation: Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)  
   - Frequency Bands: 5 GHz (preferred for streaming)  
   - Special Features: Supports high-speed streaming and low-latency gaming  

Wi-Fi Generations & Features:
| Wi-Fi Generation | Standard | Frequency | Max Speed | Features |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Wi-Fi 1 | 802.11 | 2.4 GHz | 2 Mbps | First version of Wi-Fi |
| Wi-Fi 2 | 802.11b | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | Longer range but slow | Wi-Fi 3 | 802.11g | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | Improved speed over 802.11b |
| Wi-Fi 4 | 802.11n | 2.4 & 5 GHz | 600 Mbps | MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) |
| Wi-Fi 5 | 802.11ac | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps | Beamforming for better range |
| Wi-Fi 6 | 802.11ax | 2.4, 5 & 6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps | OFDMA, MU-MIMO, energy efficiency |

3. What is BSS and ESS?  
- BSS (Basic Service Set):
  - A single Wi-Fi access point (AP) with connected devices.  
  - Used in homes, small offices, or classrooms.  
  - Example: Your home router creates a BSS for your devices.  

- ESS (Extended Service Set):
  - Multiple APs connected together, forming a larger Wi-Fi network.  
  - Devices can roam between APs without disconnecting.  
  - Used in large buildings, universities, or airports.  

4. What are the basic functionalities of a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)?  
A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) is a device that enables wireless communication in a network.  
- Provides wireless internet access  
- Converts wired signals into wireless signals 
- Manages multiple devices using MU-MIMO  
- Handles authentication (WPA2, WPA3 security protocols)  
- Extends network range (Used in large networks like airports, malls, or campuses)  

5. Difference between Bridge Mode and Repeater Mode?
| Feature | Bridge Mode | Repeater Mode |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| Function | Connects two different networks | Extends an existing Wi-Fi signal |
| Network Type | Creates a unified wired/wireless network | Expands coverage of one network |
| IP Address | Devices retain original IP addresses | May create a new subnet |
| Example | Ethernet-to-Wi-Fi bridge | Wi-Fi extenders used at home |

6. Differences between 802.11a and 802.11b?
| Feature  | 802.11a | 802.11b |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Frequency | 5 GHz | 2.4 GHz |
| Max Speed | 54 Mbps | 11 Mbps |
| Range | Shorter | Longer |
| Interference | Less (fewer devices on 5 GHz) | More (many devices use 2.4 GHz) |

7. Configure your Wi-Fi on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, compare performance.  
2.4 GHz  
- Pros: Better range, penetrates walls well  
- Cons: More interference, slower speeds  

5 GHz  
- Pros: Faster speeds, less interference  
- Cons: Shorter range, struggles with obstacles  

8. Difference between IEEE and WFA?  
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
  - Develops technical Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11ac, 802.11ax).  
  - Defines how Wi-Fi works at a technical level.  

- WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance) 
  - Certifies devices to ensure they meet Wi-Fi standards.  
  - Ensures interoperability across brands (e.g., Wi-Fi CERTIFIED logo).  


9. Types of Wi-Fi internet connectivity backhaul (Home/College Wi-Fi).  
Backhaul refers to how data is transmitted from the main network to local access points.  

| Backhaul Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Fiber-optic | College campus, high-speed networks |
| Ethernet | Office buildings, wired backbone |
| Cellular (4G/5G) | Mobile hotspots, backup internet |
| Satellite | Remote areas, research stations |

Your Home/College Wi-Fi Example:
- Home Wi-Fi: Likely uses fiber or broadband Ethernet backhaul.  
- College Wi-Fi: Uses fiber backhaul with multiple APs for coverage.  

10. List down Wi-Fi topologies and their use cases.  
1. Infrastructure Mode (Most common) 
- Uses a router/AP to manage traffic.  
- Used in homes, offices, universities.  

2. Ad-hoc Mode (Peer-to-peer Wi-Fi)  
- Devices connect directly without a router.  
- Used in file sharing, emergency networks.  

3. Mesh Network (Seamless Coverage)
- Multiple APs work together to cover large areas.  
- Used in smart homes, large buildings, outdoor Wi-Fi.
