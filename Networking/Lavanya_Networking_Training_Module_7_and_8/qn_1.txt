Test-Connection & Nslookup Commands  

 1. Test-Connection  
- This command is used to check if a website or network destination is reachable.  
- It works similarly to the ping command but provides more detailed results.  

 Example Usage in PowerShell:  
```powershell
Test-Connection www.google.com
```
Verification:  
- I verified the reachability using the tracert command to trace the route to the destination.  


 2. Nslookup  
- The `nslookup` command retrieves the IP address of a domain name, allowing us to resolve domain names to IPs.  

 Example Usage in PowerShell:  
```powershell
nslookup www.google.com
```
Verification:  
- I manually entered the retrieved IP address in the browser (Chrome), and it successfully opened the Google homepage.
