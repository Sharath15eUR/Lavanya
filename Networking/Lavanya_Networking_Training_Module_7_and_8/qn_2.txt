 DNS, TCP, and UDP Protocols  

 1. DNS Protocol  
 The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing web browsers to locate websites.  
 It plays a crucial role in internet communication by mapping human friendly URLs to machine-readable IPs.  

 Observation Using Wireshark:  
 I searched for www.google.com, which provided the IP address of the site.  
 Captured DNS Query Request:  
  ```
  Standard query A www.google.com
  ```
 Captured DNS Response:  
  ```
  142.250.193.138 (IP for www.google.com)
  ```



 2. TCP Protocol  
 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission.  
 It uses a threeway handshake to establish a connection:  
  1. SYN – Initiates connection  
  2. SYNACK – Acknowledgment  
  3. ACK – Connection established  
 It also closes the connection using a four step handshake: FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK  

 Observation Using Wireshark:  
 I used ping and tracert commands to capture TCP packets.  
 Observed source and destination ports:  
  ```
  Source Port: 58345  
  Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)  
  Flag: SYN  
  ```
 Applied a filter to capture only TCP handshakes:  
  ```
  tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==0
  ```

 3. UDP Protocol  
 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless, lightweight, and unreliable protocol.  
 It is typically used for realtime applications like:  
   VoIP (Voice over IP)  
   Video conferencing  
   Streaming services  

 Observation Using Wireshark:  
 To generate UDP traffic, I used Skype, which produced UDP packets.
