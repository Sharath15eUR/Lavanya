Traceroute (Tracert) Command in Windows  

 What is Traceroute?  
 `tracert` (Windows version of traceroute) is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path packets take from your device to a destination (e.g., `www.google.com`).  
 It helps in identifying routing issues and checking if packets reach the destination.  
 It provides a detailed map of the network path, displaying each intermediate router or "hop" along the way.

| Command | Description |
|||
| `tracert www.google.com` | Runs a basic Tracert to a specified destination (IP or domain). |
| `tracert d www.google.com` | Disables DNS resolution, showing only IP addresses instead of hostnames. |
| `tracert h 20 www.google.com` | Limits the maximum number of hops to 20 before stopping. |
| `tracert w 1000 www.google.com` | Sets a timeout of 1000 ms (default is 4000 ms) for each hop. |
