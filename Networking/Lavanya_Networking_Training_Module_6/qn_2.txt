 Routing in Networks  

 What is Routing?  
- Routing is the process of determining how data packets travel between different networks and devices.  
- Routers are responsible for directing traffic across networks to ensure efficient data delivery.  
- There are two types of routing:  
  - Static Routing: Manually configured paths for data packets (used in simple networks).  
  - Dynamic Routing: Uses protocols like RIP, OSPF, or BGP to determine the best path automatically.  

 Static Routing Setup (Using Cisco Packet Tracer)  
In this scenario, I implemented Static Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer for a simple two-LAN system consisting of:  
- 2 Routers (Router5 & Router6)  
- 2 Switches (one for each LAN)  
- 4 PCs (2 in each LAN)  
- Copper Crossover Cable to connect the routers  

 Router Configuration  

 Router5 Configuration:  
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
```

 Router6 Configuration:  
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit
```

 Configuring Static Routes  
Since these two routers are on different networks, we need to manually define the paths between them.  

 Static Route on Router5 (To reach 192.168.2.0/24 via Router6):  
```plaintext
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
```

  Static Route on Router6 (To reach 192.168.1.0/24 via Router5):  
```plaintext
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
```

 PC Configurations  
Each PC is assigned an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway as follows:  

| PC  | IP Address      | Subnet Mask      | Default Gateway  |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| PC0 | 192.168.1.10        | 255.255.255.0        | 192.168.1.1          |
| PC1 | 192.168.1.11        | 255.255.255.0        | 192.168.1.1          |
| PC2 | 192.168.2.10        | 255.255.255.0        | 192.168.2.1          |
| PC3 | 192.168.2.11        | 255.255.255.0        | 192.168.2.1          |

 Testing Connectivity  

 Ping Test  
To verify that the routing configuration is working:  
- I used the ping command from PC0 (System 1) to PC2 (System 2).  
- Successful replies confirmed that packets were properly forwarded between the networks.  

 Viewing Routing Tables  
I used the following command on both routers to check their routing tables:  
```plaintext
show ip route
```

 Tracing the Route (tracert command)  
To observe how packets travel from PC0 to PC2, I used:  
```plaintext
tracert 192.168.2.10
```
The packet traveled through 3 hops:  
 `192.168.1.1` → Router5 (Default Gateway for PC0)  
 `10.0.0.2` → Router6 (Router5 forwards the packet to Router6)  
 `192.168.2.10` → PC2 (Router6 forwards the packet to its destination)
