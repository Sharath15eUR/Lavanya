 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)  

 What is ARP?  
 ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a network.  
 When a device needs to communicate with another device on the same Local Area Network (LAN), it requires the recipientâ€™s MAC address. If the MAC address is unknown, ARP is used to retrieve it.  

 How ARP Works?  
ARP operates through two key processes:  

 ARP Request (Broadcast)  
 The sender (e.g., a router) sends an ARP Request packet to all devices on the network.  
 The request message is:  
   "Who has IP `192.168.1.4`? Tell `192.168.1.1`."  
 This is a broadcast message sent to `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` (all devices on the LAN).  

 ARP Reply (Unicast)  
 The device with IP `192.168.1.4` responds with its MAC address.  
 The reply message is:  
  "192.168.1.4 is at `B0:60:88:D0:AF:84`."  
 This is a unicast message, sent directly to the requester (`192.168.1.1`).

 Importance of ARP in Data Forwarding  
* IPtoMAC Address Resolution: ARP helps devices map IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling network communication.  
* Enables LAN Communication: In an Ethernetbased LAN, ARP ensures devices can send packets by determining the correct MAC address of the destination.  
* Efficient Communication via ARP Cache: ARP stores resolved MAC addresses in an ARP cache to minimize repeated ARP requests, reducing network traffic.  
* ARP Spoofing Risk: Cached MAC addresses can be manipulated by attackers, leading to security threats like ARP Spoofing.  
* Essential for Ethernet Networks: Without ARP, Ethernetbased LAN communication would not be possible since devices wouldn't know where to send packets.
