 IP Address Classification & NAT Handling  

 Given IP Addresses  

| IP Address | Class | Private/Public | Description |
|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| 192.168.10.5 | Class C | Private | Falls within `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255` (Private IP range) |
| 172.20.15.1 | Class B | Private | Falls within `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255` (Private IP range) |
| 8.8.8.8 | Class A | Public | Does not fall in any private range (Public IP, Google DNS) |

 How NAT Handles Private IPs for Internet Access  

 Why is NAT Needed?  
- Private IP addresses are used within local networks and cannot communicate directly with the internet.  
- Network Address Translation (NAT) enables devices with private IPs to access the internet by translating them into public IPs.  

 NAT Process (Step-by-Step)  

 A device with a private IP (e.g., 192.168.10.5) sends a request to an external website (e.g., 8.8.8.8 - Google DNS).  

The router (configured with NAT) captures the request and replaces the private IP with its own public IP.  

The request is then sent over the internet to the destination (8.8.8.8).  

When the response returns, it reaches the routerâ€™s public IP.  

The router translates the public IP back to the original private IP and forwards the response to the correct device.  

 Types of NAT  
- Static NAT: Maps a private IP to a fixed public IP.  
- Dynamic NAT: Assigns a public IP from a pool dynamically.  
- PAT (Port Address Translation): Uses a single public IP and differentiates requests via ports (most common type).
