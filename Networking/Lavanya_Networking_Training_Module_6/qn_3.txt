Subnetting and Routing in a Network  

 Subnet Division  

 Given Network:  
- Network Address: `10.0.0.0/24`  
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`  
- Binary Representation: `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`  
- First 24 bits are used for the network, while the last 8 bits are for hosts.  

 Dividing into 4 Equal Subnets  
- To divide the network into 4 subnets, we need 2 additional bits from the host portion.  
- This changes the subnet mask to `/26`:  
  - New Subnet Mask (Binary): `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`  
  - New Subnet Mask (Decimal): `255.255.255.192`  
- Number of Subnets: `2^2 = 4`  
- Subnet Size: `2^(32-26) = 2^6 = 64 IPs`  
- Usable Hosts per Subnet: `64 - 2 = 62` (excluding network and broadcast addresses).  

 Subnet Details  

| Subnet | Network Address | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast Address |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Subnet 1 | `10.0.0.0/26`   | `10.0.0.1`   | `10.0.0.62`   | `10.0.0.63`   |
| Subnet 2 | `10.0.0.64/26`  | `10.0.0.65`  | `10.0.0.126`  | `10.0.0.127`  |
| Subnet 3 | `10.0.0.128/26` | `10.0.0.129` | `10.0.0.190`  | `10.0.0.191`  |
| Subnet 4 | `10.0.0.192/26` | `10.0.0.193` | `10.0.0.254`  | `10.0.0.255`  |


 Network Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer  

 Steps:  
Created a network topology with:  
   - 2 Routers  
   - 4 Switches (one per subnet)  
   - 8 PCs (two per subnet)  

Configured the routers and set up static routing:  
   - Router1 → Routes to Subnet 3 & Subnet 4  
   - Router2 → Routes to Subnet 1 & Subnet 2  

 Tested connectivity:  
   - Used the ping command from PC0 (Subnet 1) to PC4 (Subnet 3)  
   - Successful replies confirmed proper communication.  

Verified packet flow using `tracert`:  
   - Found the path of packet transmission between different subnets.
