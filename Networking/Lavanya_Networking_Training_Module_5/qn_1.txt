ARP Protocol

Overview:

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a network protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address (hardware address).

It is primarily used for communication within a local area network (LAN) or Ethernet.

ARP operates at the network layer.

Process:

When a sender device wants to communicate, it first checks its ARP cache for the receiver’s MAC address:

If the MAC address is found in the cache, the sender directly communicates with the receiver.

If not, the sender broadcasts an ARP request containing its own MAC/IP while leaving the receiver’s MAC field blank.

All devices in the LAN receive this request, but only the intended recipient (with the matching IP address) responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address.

The sender updates its ARP cache and proceeds with communication.

Steps to Capture ARP Packets:

A simple network was set up with two PCs and an Ethernet switch.

Each PC was assigned static IP addresses: 192.168.1.1/24 and 192.168.1.2/24.

Wireshark was used to capture network packets.

The ping 192.168.1.2 command was executed from PC1 to capture ARP packets.

A filter was applied in Wireshark to display only ARP protocol packets.

ARP Packet Structure:

1. ARP Request Frame:

Sender MAC: MAC address of the device sending the request.

Sender IP: IP address of the sender requesting the MAC address.

Target MAC: Initially set to 00:00:00:00:00:00 (unknown).

Target IP: IP address of the intended recipient.

Broadcast MAC: Sent to FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF to reach all devices in the network.

2. ARP Reply Frame:

Sender MAC: MAC address of the responding device.

Sender IP: IP address of the responding device.

Target MAC: MAC address of the original sender.

Target IP: IP address of the sender that made the request.

Unicast MAC: Sent directly to the requester's MAC address.

Observations:

ARP Request:

Sender MAC & IP: PC1 broadcasts, “Who has 192.168.1.2? Tell 192.168.1.1.”

Target MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (broadcast).

ARP Reply:

Sender MAC & IP: PC2 responds, “192.168.1.2 is at 00:50:79:66:68:01.”

Target MAC: MAC address of PC1.

Packet Type: Unicast (sent directly to PC1).

This process ensures efficient network communication by resolving IP addresses to MAC addresses dynamically.
