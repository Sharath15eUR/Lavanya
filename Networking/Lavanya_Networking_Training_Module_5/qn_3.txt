Manually Configuring Static IPs on Client Devices  

 What is a Static IP?  
- A static IP address is a fixed, manually assigned IP that does not change over time.  
- Unlike a dynamic IP, which is assigned by a DHCP server and may change periodically, a static IP remains constant, providing more stability for certain network applications.

 Steps to Assign a Static IP on Windows:  

1. Open Network Settings:  
   - Navigate to:  
     Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network and Sharing Center → Change adapter settings  

2. Select Network Interface:  
   - From the list of available network interfaces, I selected Wi-Fi as my active connection.  

3. Configure TCP/IPv4 Settings:  
   - Open Wi-Fi Properties → Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties  
   - Manually enter the following values:  
     ```
     IP Address: 192.168.1.101  
     Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
     Default Gateway: 192.168.1.100  
     DNS Server: 8.8.8.8  
     ```  

4. Apply Changes & Verify:  
   - After saving the changes, I opened Command Prompt (CMD) and ran:  
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```
   - The output confirmed that the static IP was successfully assigned.

 Testing Network Connectivity  

1. Ping Default Gateway:  
   - To verify network connectivity, I ran:  
     ```
     ping 192.168.1.100
     ```
   - The command returned replies, confirming proper packet transmission.  

2. Ping Own IP:  
   - I tested if the system recognized its own IP:  
     ```
     ping 192.168.1.101
     ```
   - Received replies with no packet loss, ensuring local network functionality.  

3. Checking Internet & DNS Connectivity:  
   - Attempted to ping the public Google DNS server:  
     ```
     ping 8.8.8.8
     ```
   - The request failed, indicating an issue with DNS resolution or external network access.  



 Difficulties Faced:  
- Failure to connect to DNS (8.8.8.8) suggested a potential issue with:  
  - Incorrect gateway configuration.  
  - Firewall or network restrictions.  
  - ISP or router settings blocking external DNS access.
