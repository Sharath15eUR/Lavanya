ARP Spoofing
ARP spoofing is a cyber attack that allows hackers to intercept, modify, or block network communications between devices. By exploiting ARP’s lack of authentication, attackers can deceive devices into sending data to a malicious system instead of the intended destination.  

Experiment Steps: 

1. Network Setup:  
   - Created a system with two PCs, a switch, and a router.  
   - Assigned **static IP addresses** to all components.  

2. Assigning a Static IP to the Switch:
   ```
   enable  
   configure terminal  
   interface vlan 1  
   ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0  
   no shutdown  
   exit  
   write memory  
   ```  

3. Assigning a Static IP to the Router:  
   ```
   enable  
   configure terminal  
   interface gigabitEthernet 0/1  
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0  
   no shutdown  
   exit  
   write memory  
   ```  

4. Performing ARP Spoofing Attack:  
   - Change the MAC address of the router to match the attacker's PC.  
   - Ping PC1 to the router to establish communication.  
   - Check the ARP table using:  
     ```
     arp -a
     ```  

Observations:  
- Before the attack: Normal packet transfer occurs between the victim PC and the router.  
- After the attack:  
  - The router’s MAC address is replaced with the attacker’s MAC in the victim’s ARP table.  
  - Now, all network traffic intended for the router is redirected to the attacker’s PC.  
  - The victim PC unknowingly sends data to the attacker instead of the router, making it vulnerable to data theft or malware injection.  
- Visualizing the Attack:  
  - The ARP table confirms that the victim is communicating with a malicious system instead of the router.
