LAN Setup and packet capture :

i) Using Cisco Packet tracer:
> I have used Cisco packet tracer to setup a small network using a switch 2960 and 3 Laptop's.
> I have assigned ip's to individual Laptop's starting from 128.63.8.1(Laptop-1) , 128.63.8.2(Laptop-2) ,128.63.8.3(Laptop-3) using the desktop's ip configuration menu.
> Then I used ping command for pinging the Laptop's to one another.For example, I used ping 128.63.8.2 (Laptop-2) in the Laptop-1's cmd and verified that it doesn't created any traffic issues.
> After successful verification of all the individual Laptop's ,I moved on to the switch's part.
> I enabled the switch using the command enable and then used the command # show mac address-table to check the switch's mac address table.

ii)Using GNS3:
> I tried to connect the wireshark and Cisco packet tracer but I was not able to do that. After searching in various sites, I installed GNS3 for capturing packets.
> I made a simple network using a switch and 3 Laptop's.
> I moved on to the console option of Laptop's and used :
           ip 128.63.8.1/24 (for Laptop1) 
           ip 128.63.8.2/24 (for Laptop2) 
           ip 128.63.8.3/24 (for Laptop3)  for manually assigning the ip  statically.
> Then I right clicked the link between switch and Laptop and chose "start capture" which automatically opened the wireshark applicattion, then I selected the interface as ethernet and started "Capture".
> On the console of Laptop I used the ping command with ip of another Laptop and observed  the packet transfer from the specified source to destination.
